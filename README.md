DaiRich self-managed bank account

What If?

You could have your own account that is always earning you Dai – in the background – in real time!

With an automated allocation for investing and with thresholds and limits that YOU control

No need to lock your Dai away to earn interest

## Summary

This project is a proof of concept for self managed bank account in which if the balance of an account is higher than a threshold
that exceeded is invested automatically. 
If the balance goes below another threshold the account is recovered from the investement made earlier if there were any and it keeps
always a minimum balance in the account for daily usage.

Lastly, if the account is overdraft, i.e. balance goes below 0, the system will ask for a flash loan so we could pay a small amount
and then pay it back later.
